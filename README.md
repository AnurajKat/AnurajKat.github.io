Site development as a part of curriculum in my college. The site is about humour related to Computer Science. Jokes and Memes
have been directly or indirectly taken from reddit (www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor).Screenshots are of the comments section of posts in 
the Reddit. Site Design is an attempt to replicate the layout of imgur (www.imgur.com) with observable changes.
